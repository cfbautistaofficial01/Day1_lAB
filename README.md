# Day 1 Afternoon Lab: The Investigator's Report

**Your Mission:** For the next three hours (1:00 PM - 4:00 PM), you are no longer a trainee. You are a **Cyber Investigator**. Your mission is to research a famous real-world cyberattack and build a simple case file, using the new terms you learned this morning.

**Your Goal:** To practice identifying the key components of an attack. This will help you learn to think like an analyst.

### Your Task: A Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Get Your Case File:** Your trainer (me!) will assign you one of the famous breaches listed below.
2.  **Conduct Your Investigation:** Use Google to find information about your assigned breach. This is a research and reading task.
    * **Pro Tip for Beginners:** Use simple search terms like:
        * "Equifax breach 2017 **summary**"
        * "Target breach 2013 **how it happened**"
        * "What **vulnerability** caused the Equifax breach"
3.  **Answer the "Big Three" Questions:** As you read, your goal is to find the answers to the three questions on the next page.
4.  **Write Your Report:** Create a simple 1-page document (using a text file, Word, or Google Docs).
5.  **Submit Your Findings:** Have your report ready by 4:00 PM for our group discussion.

### The "Big Three" Investigator's Questions

*Your 1-page report must answer these three questions clearly.*

#### 1. The Asset (The "Crown Jewels")

* **Question:** What did the attackers *want*? What did they steal?
* **What this means:** Were they after customer credit card numbers? Personal data like Social Security Numbers (SSNs), names, and addresses? Or were they trying to steal company secrets?

#### 2. The Threat (The "Attacker")

* **Question:** Who *did* the attack?
* **What this means:** Was it a specific, named hacking group (like "Medusa" or "DarkSide")? Was it a single person? Was it an "insider threat" (an employee)? You might not find a specific name, but you can describe them (e.g., "An organized cybercrime group").

#### 3. The Vulnerability (The "Broken Wall")

* **Question:** How did the attackers *get in*?
* **What this means:** This is the most important question. Did they find a server that was missing a security patch? Did an employee click a phishing email and give away their password? Was a password weak and easy to guess? Find the *root cause* of the breach.

### Case Files (Choose One)

* **Case 1:** The 2017 Equifax Breach
* **Case 2:** The 2013 Target Breach
* **Case 3:** The 2018 Marriott (Starwood) Breach
* **Case 4:** The 2020 SolarWinds Attack (This one is more advanced!)
